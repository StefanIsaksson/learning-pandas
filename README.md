# Learning about Pandas

## What
This repository contains Pandas examples.
Most of the examples can be opened with Jupyter notebook (https://jupyter.org/) and the code is written in Python.

## Why
1. Exploring data and creating visualisation with Pandas seems to be a useful skill to learn, and fun to do.
2. Manipulating and cleaning data (with for instance Pandas) is important first step in the machine learning process.
